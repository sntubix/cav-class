There are hundreds of ways to proceed, eg. by changing contrast, lightly blurring images, flipping them horizontally, taking crops, adding light noise on them, ... Be creative! A combination of search engine use and the `transform` module of the `torchvision` library might be very helpful for this. You can implement this in a flexible way by simply adding an `augment(x)` functiont that applies a random augmentation on a batch `x` and call it inside the training loop.\n",

    "You should aim the best possible accuracy on the test set (95%+ is a good milestone). Of course, you should not use performance on the test set to tune your model, only the validation set.
